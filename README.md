# Dice Roller for Tiny Epic Galaxies

I made this simple html page to roll dice for Tiny Epic Galaxies, the sound of dice was irritating when playing solo late at night. You can open the index.html in your browser or use a web server. Uses d6.js to animate the dice roll.

Usage:

The page is divided in three areas:
* The top area shows dice with numbers, they are used for a new roll, click the number of dice to roll.
* The middle area shows the current roll, click the button "Roll Dice" to reroll, click on a die to switch between dices to reroll and to keep the value
* The bottom area shows previous rolls

Works great using a phone or tablet.
